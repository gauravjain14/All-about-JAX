        "1. To do some old-school print-based debugging, I had disabled @jax.jit decorators but then forgot to re-enable them before I ran my training loops. That was a bad move! The difference in the training time with and without @jax.jit is significant with the former being at least 5x faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It took me a good amount of time and a lot of code-copying from the original repository to finally get this implementation right. Implementing a model in JAX/Flax is still going to take me a considerable amount of practice. Nevertheless, we'll get there."
